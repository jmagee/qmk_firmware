jmagee's Planck Layout
======================

Abstract
--------
My Planck layout is a QWERTY layout characterized primarily by:

 * Modal concept, implementing using layers
 * Heavy use of leader sequences

Modes
-----
Modes are implemented by layers, but I refer to them as modes because of the
following properties:

 * It is possible to transition from any mode to any other mode.
 * Conceptually, no two modes are in operation at once.
   * Pedantically, this is not quite true.  The default persistent layer (QWERTY) is always enabled, and then different modes are swapped in and out.  I consider this just an implementation detail.
 * There is no lower or raise concept exposed in the layout.
